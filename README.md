First attempt to create a page for a contemporary artist Michał Król.

After making some HTML+CSS only websites there was a time to learn JavaScript. A lot of hours and tutorials later, after dealing, mostly, with cuting arrays and writing
some crazy conditionals I needed to get some real-life experience and make my websites come alive. This page is not very pretty or well-written but it showed me how I can use 
JavaScript to make computer act as I intended. I was aware of many mistakes I have made in this project but i thought it will show nicely that I am able to fix them and that 
I can learn a lot from one project to another. The 404 redirection does not work because GitHub pages does not support .htaccess files.
